# Satellite Sounds
Satellite sounds is collection of image captures from ambient satellite transmissions. Radio Signals are overwhelming. Transmissions from indifferent devices, near or far, swarm the air around us as we push through our cities unaware of all information not meant for us. Amongst the information not necessarily meant for us are the signals transmitted from unmanned meteorological satellites.
